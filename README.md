In this app I had to use external API and learn deeply about http protocols. Up until today I only worked with static data, while here I used fetch and axios APIs requests to embed and manipluate data in my app.

I took this oppurtinity to better understand several key concepts in modren JS, such as Promises, async/await and http protocols. 

I used React hooks to adjust to modren app. I also used Heroku as deployment base and Bootstrap for styling.
